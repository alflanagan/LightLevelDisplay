# Light Level Display

This is a dirt-simple app that does nothing but display the light level detected by the light sensor &mdash; AND provide a widget to do the same thing. I though it would be neat to be able to monitor light levels without opening an app. This is only useful if I can get the widget working.


NOTE: the build environment is gradle, the project is set up for use with Android Studio 3.3 (the production version). You of course can use any IDE or editor you prefer <sup>1</sup>. However, if you wish to run tests against Android Q Sdk, Google recommends version 3.5 (currently the canary version).
