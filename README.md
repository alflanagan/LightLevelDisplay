# Light Level Display

## ARCHIVED

Google has disabled the ability to update a widget in Android as I'd like on the grounds it would consume too many resources. Which it does. Thus this is only potentially useful on older versions of Android. No further development is expected unless I find some other way to make it work.

## Old Description

This is a dirt-simple app that does nothing but display the light level detected by the light sensor &mdash; AND provide a widget to do the same thing. I though it would be neat to be able to monitor light levels without opening an app. This is only useful if I can get the widget working.


NOTE: the build environment is gradle, the project is set up for use with Android Studio 3.3 (the production version). You of course can use any IDE or editor you prefer <sup>1</sup>. However, if you wish to run tests against Android Q Sdk, Google recommends version 3.5 (currently the canary version).
